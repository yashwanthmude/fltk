I made an array of numbers 0 to 15.
I then shuffled them and wrote a code for checking it's solvability.
It shuffles maintaining the condition of solvability.
I made the empty button red and remaining buttons yellow and increased the label size to 30.
I declared an array to store the numbers, a pointer that points to empty button always and a two dimensinal array of button pointers containing the addresses of the sixteen buttons.
In class my button , I declared two extra variables namely x_coordinate and y_coordinate to check the neighbours to empty button easily.
I made a function named change_number_and_color to swap the color of empty button and neighbour button after a valid click and updating the numbers array.
